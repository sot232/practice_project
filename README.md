## Chatbot
### MovieFriendBot
I created a chatbot as following the tutorial provided by Jeongsoo, Park. I used Telegram, Bothub Studio, and Python. The chatbot fulfills two purposes. It gives a list of popular movies and provides where a closest movie theater is. It should list movie showtimes at a specific theater, but I wasn't able to check this feature because I haven't been to Korea for a few years. This feature works if you use the chatbot service in Korea. Here is the link of the tutorial: http://static.wooridle.net/lectures/chatbot/
