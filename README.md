# Chatbot
### MovieFriendBot
I created a chatbot as following the tutorial provided by Jeongsoo, Park. I used Telegram, Bothub Studio, and Python. The chatbot fulfills two purposes. It gives a list of popular movies and provides where a closest movie theater is. It should list movie showtimes at a specific theater, but I wasn't able to check this feature because I haven't been to Korea for a few years. This feature works if you use the chatbot service in Korea. Here is the link of the tutorial: http://static.wooridle.net/lectures/chatbot/

I made a simple snake game by using Python. I followed the instruction from https://www.udemy.com/python-game-development-creating-a-snake-game-from-scratch/learn/v4/overview

# WebDev
### Udemy-BootCamp
I completed 60% of the course on Udemy. (https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/learn/v4/overview) I learned about Bootstrap, jQuery, Node JS, Express JS, and how to work with API's. This course was really fun and helpful!

### Do-It-HTML5
I made really simple documents by using HTML and CSS. Do-It-HTML5 is a book. I did activities that the book assigned me to do.

# Applied and Computational Mathematics
I am not allowed to share my code. I used Python and its libraries.  
### Linked List
"In this lab, we introduce a basic data structure called a linked list and create a class to implement it."
Chapter 1 on https://github.com/Foundations-of-Applied-Mathematics/Labs/raw/master/docs/Volume2.pdf

### Trees
"A tree is link-based data structure where each node may refer to more than one other node. This structure makes trees more useful and efficient than regular linked lists in many applications. Many trees are constructed recursively, so we begin with an overview of recursion. We then implement a recursively structured doubly linked binary search tree (BST). Finally, we compare the standard linked list, our BST, and an AVL tree to illustrate the relative strengths and weaknesses of each data structure."
Chapter 2 on https://github.com/Foundations-of-Applied-Mathematics/Labs/raw/master/docs/Volume2.pdf

### Nearest Neighbor
"The nearest neighbor problem is an optimization problem that arises in applications such as computer vision, internet marketing, and data compression. The problem can be solved efficiently with a k-d tree, a generalization of the binary search tree. In this lab we implement a k-d tree, use it to solve the nearest neighbor problem, then use that solution as the basis of an elementary machine learning algorithm."
I constructed a k-d tree which is a generalized binary search tree where each node in the tree contains k-demensional data. And I used the tree to perform the nearest neighbor search. I solved a handwriting recognition problem based on a k-nearest neighbor clasifier.

### Breadth-first Search (BFS)
"Shortest path problems are an important part of graph theory and network analysis. Applications include finding the fastest way to drive between two points on a map, network routing, genealogy, automated circuit layout, and a variety of other important problems. In this lab we represent graphs as adjacency dictionaries, implement a shortest path algorithm based on a breadth- first search, and use the NetworkX package to solve a shortest path problem on a large network of movies and actors."
I tried to find shortest paths via BFS and NetworkX. NetworkX is a Python package for creating, manipulating, and exploring graphs. I solved the Six degrees of Kevin Bacon problem. (Link for the problem: http://oracleofbacon.org/help.php)
Chapter 4 on https://github.com/Foundations-of-Applied-Mathematics/Labs/raw/master/docs/Volume2.pdf

### Markov Chains
"A Markov chain is a collection of states with specified probabilities for transi- tioning from one state to another. They are characterized by the fact that the future behavior of the system depends only on its current state. In this lab, we learn to construct, analyze, and interact with Markov chains, then use a Markov-based approach to simulate natural language."
I learned about a Markov chain and its usage as a natural language processing application and other applications. Google's PageRank algorithm uses a Markov chain-based approach to rank web pages. A Markov chain can be useful for a probability distribution.

### SQL
The resource can't be found on the Internet. The material hasn't been published yet. But I learned how to use SQLite in Python. I constructed and manipulated a local-based database.

### Fourier Transform
"In this lab, we introduce how to work with digital audio signals in Python, implement the discrete Fourier transform, and use the Fourier transform to detect the frequencies present in a given sound wave."
Chapter 6 on https://github.com/Foundations-of-Applied-Mathematics/Labs/raw/master/docs/Volume2.pdf

### Linear Transformations
"In this lab we visually explore how linear transformations alter points in the Cartesian plane. We also empirically explore the computational cost of applying linear transformations via matrix multiplication."
Chapter 1 on https://github.com/Foundations-of-Applied-Mathematics/Labs/raw/master/docs/Volume1.pdf

### Linear Systems
"In this lab we implement the LU decomposition and use it to solve square linear systems. We also introduce SciPy, together with its libraries for linear algebra and working with sparse matrices."
Chapter 2 on https://github.com/Foundations-of-Applied-Mathematics/Labs/raw/master/docs/Volume1.pdf

### Unit Testing
"In this lab, we learn to write unit tests in Python and practice test-driven development."
I learned about PyTest and Test-driven Development.
Chapter 7 on https://github.com/Foundations-of-Applied-Mathematics/Labs/raw/master/docs/PythonEssentials.pdf

### QR Decomposition
"In this lab, we explore several ways to produce the QR decomposition and implement a few immediate applications."
Chapter 3 on https://github.com/Foundations-of-Applied-Mathematics/Labs/raw/master/docs/Volume1.pdf

### Least Squares and Computing Eigenvalues
"In this lab, we introduce linear least squares problems, tools in Python for computing least squares solutions, and two fundamental algorithms for computing eigenvalue. The QR decomposition makes solving several of these problems quick and numerically stable."
This activity taught me some machine learning skills. "The least squares solution can be used to find the best fit curve of a chosen type to a set of points." In other words, It can be used for simple linear, polynomial, and non-linear progression problems. 
Chapter 4 on https://github.com/Foundations-of-Applied-Mathematics/Labs/raw/master/docs/Volume1.pdf

### Image Segmentation
"In this lab, we study a common matrix representation for graphs and show how certain properties of the matrix representation correspond to inherent properties of the original graph. We also introduce tools for working with images in Python, and conclude with an application of using graphs and linear algebra to segment images."
I learned about graphs and images as matrices. I constructed the image graph with matrices.
Chapter 5 on https://github.com/Foundations-of-Applied-Mathematics/Labs/raw/master/docs/Volume1.pdf

### SVD and Image Compression
"The Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is an incredibly useful matrix factor- ization that is widely used in both theoretical and applied mathematics. ... In this lab we learn to compute the SVD and use it to implement a simple image compression routine."
I compressed images based on ranks.
Chapter 6 on https://github.com/Foundations-of-Applied-Mathematics/Labs/raw/master/docs/Volume1.pdf

### Facial Recognition
"In this lab, we implement a basic facial recognition system that relies on eigenvectors and the SVD to efficiently determine the difference between faces."
I manipulated images as applying the Eigenfaces method.
